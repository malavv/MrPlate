# MrPlate

MrPlate, a play on word on "My Stir Plate", is a project to build a neat advanced stir plate that is frankly overkilled for most uses.

My goal is the following:
  * To have exact control over rotation speed
  * Have a full display to communicate with users
  * Heating is out-of-scope

This project might move to a higher-level language such as Rust (zinc) or Go? :D but should still remain on a pretty low cost* board (such as a Teensy).

## Contributions

Contributions to this project are welcome, however since the goal will be to support specific hardware version, it is not yet clear to me how this will be done.
